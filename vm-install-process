Prototyping KODI server on VMWare Fusion Ubuntu 16.04LTS VM

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools
Install VMWare Tools and reboot
sudo apt-get install kodi

Progress

- ok got shared folders working
- got kodi installed
- created a vm share to the graid drive containing itunes media
- added music source within kodi to point to vm share
- have now noticed that air song folder which contains m4a suffixed files it recognized within kodi
- but m4p files are not recognized within kodi due to the apple drm protection
- will now try to use the trial version of noteburner to see if it can remove the drm from an m4p file if so
the full version costs £20
- noteburner looks like its only for converting drm protected video
- looks like I need noteburner-itunes-drm-audio-converter !!!! ok also trial version for this let's see
- well that's worked like a charm, so I got both programs for £59
